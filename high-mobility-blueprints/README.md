## Example 1: Charger

This example connects a car simulator to a charging station simulator and allows the car to pay for charging services.

## Example 2: MAM

This example connects to a car simulator on the High-Mobility platform and publishes location changes to a restricted MAM stream on the IOTA tangle.

## Requirements:

 - Node 8.9+
 - A High-Mobility App Client Certificate
 - High-Mobility Emulator Access Certificates
